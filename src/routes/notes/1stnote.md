#  The more time people share with each other, the more likely they are to share similar behaviors.

Humans are social creatures. By nature, individuals are influenced to some extent by the people they interact with. Logically, the more time two individuals share together, the more likely they are to share similar behaviors.

For example, a group of women sat down at The Rose Cafe in Santa Monica, CA, to celebrate a special occasion. They were all well-dressed and stylish, at least compared to tech industry standards. Several of them were wearing hats. Each of them ordered their own meal instead of sharing "family-style." Another trait these women shared were that many of them were overweight! 

It's important to reflect on your long-term goals and whether the people in your life enable you to build habits that will help you achieve your goals.
